# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

Client, Horiseon Consulting Services approached me with the opportunity to make their website more accessible to all who would visit and in general refactoring the code. Now anyone with a visual impairment will have an easier time navigating the website; and I have received practical experience in my 
HTML and CSS.

## Assignment

This is the code refactor assignment by the UCI Full Stack Developer Boot Camp.

Assignment included adding accessibility elements, further cleaning/structuring the code, and consolidating the code using elements of HTML, CSS, and finally uploading/publishing the webpage using git/github.
